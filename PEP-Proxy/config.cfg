#relativePathAttributeEncriptation: This parameter is a tridimensional array. To understand it, we are going to use the next examples:

#1. ONLY ONE CONDITION - In this case, the system searches into each the attribute first a key named "metadata", and after, into it, a key named "cpabe-policy". If it is successful, the attribute will cypher.
#- Example (NGSIv2): 
#relativePathAttributeEncriptation=[[["metadata/cpabe-policy",""]]]

#NOTE If the second element of the array is defined, the system also will verify if the value is the same as the relative path value. If it is also successful, the attribute will cypher.
        
#- Example (NGSIv1), the analog of previous NGSIv2 example: 
#relativePathAttributeEncriptation=[[["metadatas/name","cpabe-policy"]]]
        
#2. **TWO CONDITIONS AND MORE (AND)** -  In this case, the second condition must also be satisfied. It is an "and" condition. If both conditions are successful, the attribute will cypher.
#- Example (NGSIv1): 
#relativePathAttributeEncriptation=[[["metadatas/name","cpabe-policy"],["metadatas/type","policy"]]]

#3. **TWO CONDITIONS AND MORE (OR)** - In this case, if one of the conditions is successful, the attribute will cypher. It is an "or" condition.
#- Example (NGSIv1):
#relativePathAttributeEncriptation=[[["metadatas/name","cpabe-policy"]],
#                            [["metadatas/name","other-policy"]]
#                        ]

#NOTE Mixed cases are supported.
#IMPORTANT: This param is case sensitive.
#IMPORTANT: Before update this param see "Proxy PEP - updating relativePathAttributeEncriptation param" section (README).
